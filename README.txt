[Cross Numbers]

Place numbers in a cross, and find every rearrangement possible that will satisfy the following:

Each number cannot be vertically, horizontally or diagonally adjacent to a value 1 less than it or 1 greater than it (ex. 6 cannot be near 7 or 8)

The cross-board looks like this

		1	2
	0	3	4	7	
		5	6

[Fancy Queens]

[K Bishops]

[StableM]

Stable Marriage problem. Given 3 men and 3 women, where each person has ranked all members of the opposite sex with an unique number between 0 and 2 in order of preference, marry the men and women together such that there are no two people of opposite sex who would both rather have each other than their current partners. If there are no such people, all the marriages are "stable".

[Zipf's Law]

Zipf's law states that in natural languages, the number of times a word is used is inversely proportional to it's rank on a frequency table. In other words, the word most used will be used twice as many times as the next word, three times as often as the third word, and four times as often as the fourth word, etc. This program takes a number of songs, the frequency in which they are played and lists them by quality based on which tracks deviate from Zipf's Law best.
